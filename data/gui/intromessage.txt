With environmental consciousness skyrocketing over the next few years, many are wondering how they can
individually reduce greenhouse gases. Although are many ways to reduce greenhouse gas emission, like using
public transport and recycling, one of the most practical ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, specifically
methane emission, is to reduce animal product consumption. Today, we will specifically be looking at
cows and how they effect the methane emissions in general. There is a link between cow population and
methane emissions, as cow's digestion of grass (ie belching), can produce up to 264 pounds of methane for
every cow every year. In the context of the now massive market for animal products, millions and billions of
meet are produced every year. With the growing global population too, it is clear our current mass consumption
of beef and milk is unsustainable. Or is it?
